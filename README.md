# linked-list-using-c
  This code implements a singly linked list in C.  A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element is called a node. Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the list. The head pointer points to the first node in the list. The code includes functions to insert a node at the beginning of the list, insert a node at the end of the list, insert a node after a given node, and delete a node from the list.  The code also includes a function to display the contents of the list.
